//There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at 
//the iᵗʰ station is gas[i]. 
//
// You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to 
//travel from the iᵗʰ station to its next (i + 1)ᵗʰ station. You begin the journey 
//with an empty tank at one of the gas stations. 
//
// Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's 
//index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, 
//otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
//Output: 3
//Explanation:
//Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4
// = 4
//Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
//Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
//Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
//Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
//Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to 
//station 3.
//Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
//Output: -1
//Explanation:
//You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to 
//the next station.
//Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
//
//Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
//Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
//You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you 
//only have 3.
//Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
//
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// n == gas.length == cost.length 
// 1 <= n <= 10⁵ 
// 0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 10⁴ 
//
